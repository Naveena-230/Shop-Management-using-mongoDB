This is a simple web application built using Express.js, node.js, MongoDB, and Handlebars as the template engine. It allows users to manage products by adding, editing, and deleting them.

## Prerequisites
Before running the application, make sure you have the following installed:

 1. Node.js
 2. MongoDB 

## Getting Started

1. Install the necessary dependencies. For example, if you are using Node.js and npm, navigate to the project directory and run the following command:

   npm install


2. Set up a connection to your MongoDB database. This can be done by configuring the connection details in a separate file or directly in the code. Ensure you have the necessary credentials (e.g., host, port, username, password) to connect to your MongoDB instance.

3. Modify the code as needed to match your database connection settings. Look for sections of code that handle the MongoDB connection and update them accordingly.

4. Start the web server. Depending on your setup, you might run a command like:

   npm start

Ensure the server starts without any errors.

5. Open your web browser and visit http://localhost:4000 to access the application.


## Explanation

The provided code is written in HTML and uses a templating language to dynamically generate the web page content. Here's an explanation of the different parts:

### HTML Structure

The code begins with the standard HTML structure. It defines the document type, the HTML language, and includes the necessary metadata in the `<head>` section.

The `<body>` section contains the main content of the page.

### Page Title and Heading

The `<h1>` element displays the title of the page, which is "Shop Management".

### Create Operation

The code checks if the `edit_id` variable is present. If it is, the page displays an edit form. Otherwise, it displays a create form.

#### Edit Form

If the `edit_id` variable is present, the code displays an edit form. The form's `action` attribute specifies the endpoint to handle the form submission for updating a product with the given `edit_id`.

The form contains two input fields: `product name` and `price`. The values of these input fields are pre-populated with the existing products name and price (`edit_product.name` and `edit_product.price` respectively).

#### Create Form

If the `edit_id` variable is not present, the code displays a create form. The form's `action` attribute specifies the endpoint to handle the form submission for creating a new product.

The form also contains two input fields: `product name` and `price`.

### Store List

The code uses a loop (`{{#each product}}`) to iterate over a list of products.

For each product, it generates an `<li>` element containing the store's product and price. It also includes two links: "Edit" and "Delete". The "Edit" link includes the product's `_id` as a query parameter (`edit_id={{this._id}}`) to identify which shop to edit. The "Delete" link includes the product's `_id` as a query parameter (`delete_id={{this._id}}`). It also includes an `onclick` event to show a confirmation dialog before deleting the product.

### Templating Syntax

The code uses a templating language (not specified in the code snippet) to insert dynamic values into the HTML. The placeholders (`{{message}}`, `{{#if edit_id}}`, `

{{edit_id}}`, `{{edit_product.name}}`, `{{edit_product.price}}`, `{{#each product}}`, `{{this.name}}`, `{{this.price}}`) are replaced with actual values when the page is rendered.

## Conclusion

This code snippet demonstrates a basic web application that allows users to perform  operations such as insert, Update, Delete on a collection of products stored in a MongoDB database. It provides forms for creating new products and editing existing ones, as well as displaying a list of products with options to edit or delete each product.
